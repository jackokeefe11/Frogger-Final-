/// We will represent positions as GE211 `Posn<float>`s, which we alias
/// with the type name `Position`. This is a struct that could be
/// defined like so:
///
///   struct Position
///   {
///       float x;   // pixel distance from left edge of window
///       float y;   // pixel distance from top edge of window
///   };

/// We will represent velocities as GE211 `Dims<float>`s, which we alias
/// with the type name `Velocity`. This is a struct that could be
/// defined like so:
///
///   struct Velocity
///   {
///       float width;   // horizontal rate of change (px/s)
///       float height;  // vertical rate of change (px/s)
///   };
using Velocity = ge211::Dims<float>;

/// We will represent blocks (the bricks and the paddle) as GE211
/// `Rect<int>`s, which we alias with the type name `Block`. This is a
/// struct that could be defined like so:
///
///   struct Block
///   {
///       int x;       // x coordinate of left side of rectangle
///       int y;       // y coordinate of top side of rectangle
///       int width;
///       int height;
///   };

/// This struct is used to represent the state of the ball. In
/// particular, we need to know how big the ball is (radius), whether
/// it's moving or stopped (live), where it is (center), and where it's
/// going (velocity).
///
/// Note that `velocity` is a ge211::Dims<float>, which means it has two
/// `float` member variables, `width` and `height`, which store the *x*
/// and *y* components of the ball's velocity vector expressed in
/// pixels/second. This means that in each "frame", `center` needs to be
/// translated (shifted) by the `velocity` times the amount of time that
/// has passed. A `Dims<float>` may be multiplied by a `double` (or any
/// scalar type) to produce a scaled `Dims<float>` (?? la scalar???vector
/// multiplication); and a `Dims<float>` added to a `Posn<float>` yields
/// a translated `Posn<float>`. Thus, a ball `a_ball`'s position may be
/// updated by the statement:
///
///     a_ball.position += dt * a_ball.velocity;

    // CONSTRUCTOR
    //

    /// Constructs a new ball. It needs to know where the paddle is (so
    /// it can position itself right above it), and the configuration
    /// (which includes the ball's radius and initial velocity). The
    /// ball starts dead---not moving and positioned 1 pixel above the
    /// center of the paddle.
    ///
    /// In addition to constructing the ball in the model in the first
    /// place, this can also be used to reset the ball by creating a new
    /// ball to assign over it:
    ///
    ///     ball = Ball(paddle, config);
    ///
    Frog(Game_config const&);

    //
    // MEMBER FUNCTIONS
    //

    /// Returns the position of the top-left corner of the ball's
    /// "bounding box", meaning the smallest rectangle in which is can
    /// be enclosed. This is useful to the UI because sprites are
    /// positioned based on their top-left corners.
    //Position top_left() const;

    /// Returns the state of the ball after `dt` seconds have passed,
    /// were it to move freely (without obstacles). Thus, the result is
    /// a new ball just like this one but whose position has been
    /// updated based on its current velocity and the given time
    /// interval `dt`. (This is an application of the equation relating
    /// distance to velocity and time: *??d = v ??? ??t*.)
    ///
    /// This function is useful because the model's algorithm for
    /// collision detection involves speculatively moving the ball and
    /// checking where it would end up, before actually moving it.
    ///
    /// This can also be used to actually move it, via assignment:
    ///
    ///    ball = ball.next();
    ///

    /// with more than one brick, but the function should return after
    /// the first collision is found.) If there is no collision then the
    /// function returns false.
